Exported on January 21, 2023



Phone: Xiaomi Redmi 10

OS: MIUI Global 12.5.20

Android version: 11

this export was filled with apps i installed myself xdxdxd

also can t gurantee your safety w this, i tend to go quite extreme with things that were my old daily driver os

apply both this and the 13 export too for ful effec™

in case ur wondering 1 this would still work w miui 13 2 yes i downgraded 3 yes i use a custom rom now dont expect any updaye

List made with MIUI optimizations turned off, didnt test if it breaks the phone or not with it enabled

**If you are concerned with your phone's safety, the 13 export is a much safer choice.**
