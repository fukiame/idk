`com.coloros.safesdkproxy` doesnt seem to be detected by Hail, preferrably `pm uninstall --user 0 com.coloros.safesdkproxy && pm disable-user com.coloros.safesdkproxy` it

`com.nearme.gamecenter` cant be disabled or `uninstall --user`'ed, can still be suspended though (with any of Hail's suspend mode / with `pm suspend`)
